# Beer Finder

Beer Finder is a web app that uses a database to store different types of beer and connects them to activites that correlate to the strain of beer. You have the option to choose an activity and be shown a list of beers that are recommended for said activity. You also have the option of seeing and writing reviews on a specific beer/activity pairing.
